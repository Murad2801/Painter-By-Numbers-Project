# Painter-By-Numbers-Project
Implemented a deep learning project for artist classification using Siamese Networks. Leveraged transfer learning with a ResNet34 architecture for feature extraction from image pairs/triplets. Incorporated data augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity and prevent overfitting. Achieved an artist classification accuracy exceeding 80%.
